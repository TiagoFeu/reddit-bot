# reddit-bot

This is a simple bot that generates a wordcloud from the hot submissions of a subreddit topic.

In case you want to run this code, add a "credentials.json" file in the bot folder. This file must have your reddit app credentials.

**Exemple:**
{
    "client_id": "",
    "client_secret": "",
    "user_agent": "",
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
}
